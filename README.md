Acoustic energy is reflected from various boundary surfaces, so that the listener can hear the multitude of reflection from many directions. If a symphony orchestra is recorded in an anechoic room, it will sound terrible because of the lack of reverberations. Through digital signal processing techniques, we can convert a natural sound into one with rich reverberation effects; these techniques are commonly known as digital artificial reverberation. In this project, we explore a few basic digital artificial reverberation techniques, including tapped delay lines, feedback comb filters, and Schroeder all-pass filters.
